Notes:
- Trainings/Equipment can't be canceled. Otherwise updates could be using more points than available.
- Simmer will have to "finalize" updates before weekly updates.
- How to log in with forum users, and should we have a users table as well
- Milestones will have to be confirmed by a PT grader, which I believe should be done anyway
- Other TPE stuff like Equipment still needs to be figured out
- trainings could start on the day after sim updates, so from tuesday-monday. prevents "double updates"
